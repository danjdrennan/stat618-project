## Implementing Vecchia-Approximated Deep Gaussian Processes

## Description

The code in this repo implements a Vecchia approximated deep Gaussian process
(DGP; Sauer, 2022). The DGP was first proposed by Damianou and Lawrence
(2013; AISTATS). Vecchia approximations originated as a composite likelihood
technique (Vecchia, 1988), and recent work has developed rich theory around using
the technique for modeling in computer experiments and spatial statistics
(Katzfuss and Guinness, 2021).

I give a `pytorch`-based implementation of the model. An `R` package by Annie
Sauer is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deepgp/vignettes/deepgp.html).
